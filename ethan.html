		<h3>Interests</h3>
    <p>In recent years, I have found myself attracted to a vast array of fields.<br> From stories like One Piece, cosplaying various characters, one of my own prize-winning designs, and a little embroidery business that has started to grow over the past three years!</p>

    <h3>Cosplay!</h3>
    <p>My cosplay journey all started from an interest in the world of One Piece, dressing up as the main antagonist for my first convention.<br>
      And from the few compliments I received regarding the cosplay, I then started to grow it into something "more".<br>
      The introduction of a CRT TV was definitely not my first thought, and using it as a helmet was certainly the last thought. Nonetheless, popularity shot up, which I took as an opportunity<br>
      to then push my little business.</p>

    <h3>Business!</h3>
    <p>Over the last three years, I have been slowly developing my little embroidery business.<br>
      It started off as me making an embroidery for my work buddy since she helped me get involved in this career. From there, I kept making different embroideries just for fun. Soon after, people started to recognize my skill.<br>
      Then slowly people would come to me and commission some work from me. After that, the rest is history. I just kept adding to my stockpile, slowly making more patches and developing the business side of things with an ever-growing Instagram page and, as of late, business cards!</p>

    <h3>The End?</h3>
    <p>Where can I go from here? Up seems the likely direction! I'm not entirely sure where my interests will take me. Will I still have the same ones? Will they grow or fall?<br>
      What happens to me over the next few years will be for me to find out in due time. Until then, I'm gonna keep going how I have beenâ€”endlessly cheerful and perpetually dopey until time itself has had enough of me.</p>
