                    Hi, I am Tim George, a passionate future network engineer and a creative individual who loves exploring new opportunities. Whether I'm on the court playing basketball perfecting my jump shot or off the court designing innovative web experiences, I always bring my A-game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of my greatest hobbies is basketball. It has taught me discipline, teamwork, and the importance of learning from mistakes that extend to every area of my life. When I'm not playing or watching basketball, you'll often find me working on my college assignments, enjoying good food, or diving into the latest tech trends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm always excited to connect with others who share my passions or have similar perspectives to offer. Feel free to explore this site to learn more about my skills, experience, and how you can get in touch with me!
